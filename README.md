### Project 2: Vietnam Tech News Intelligence
**Week 6-8 | Web Scraping + NLP + Analysis | Planned**

**Research Question:** What are the hottest trends in Vietnam's tech ecosystem? Which technologies and topics dominate the news cycle?

**Why This Project Stands Out:**
- Original data collection - Web scraping, not pre-made datasets
- Shows initiative - Self-directed research project
- Vietnam-specific - Unique insights unavailable elsewhere
- Current & relevant - Real-time tech landscape analysis

**Data Collection Strategy:**
- Primary sources: VnExpress Tech, Genk.vn (RSS feeds - 200-300 articles)
- Secondary: TechInAsia Vietnam (web scraping if feasible)
- Time period: Recent 6-12 months of tech coverage

**Analysis Framework:**

**Week 6 - Data Collection:**
- Build RSS feed scraper (Python: feedparser, requests)
- Implement web scraper for dynamic content (BeautifulSoup/Selenium)
- Data cleaning: text normalization, duplicate removal
- Dataset: 300-400 tech news articles

**Week 7 - Text Analytics:**
- Topic modeling: Most discussed topics (AI, blockchain, startups, funding)
- Trend analysis: Topic popularity over time
- Keyword extraction: Top companies, technologies, people mentioned
- Sentiment analysis: Positive/negative/neutral distribution using TextBlob
- Temporal patterns: Publishing frequency and hot news periods

**Week 8 - Insights & Deliverables:**
- Interactive Tableau dashboard: Topic trends, word clouds, sentiment gauges
- Research report: "Vietnam Tech Landscape 2026: Data-Driven Insights"
- Blog post: "I Analyzed 300+ Vietnam Tech Articles: Here's What's Hot"
- Public dataset release on Kaggle - first Vietnamese tech news dataset

**Research Findings (Expected):**
- Top 10 most covered tech topics in Vietnam
- Which companies/startups get most media attention
- Sentiment trends (positive vs critical coverage)
- Emerging technologies gaining traction
- Content gaps and underreported topics

**Skills Showcased:** Web Scraping, NLP (Natural Language Processing), Text Analytics, Data Cleaning (messy real-world data), Python (Beautiful Soup, pandas, TextBlob), Data Visualization

**Unique Value:** Demonstrates ability to gather original data and conduct independent research - a key differentiator from candidates who only use pre-cleaned datasets.
