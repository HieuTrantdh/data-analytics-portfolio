## 📦 Project 1: Vietnam E-Commerce Price Intelligence  
**Week 2–8 | Web Scraping + SQL + Python + Deployment**  
🚧 *In Progress*

### Real Problem

- Alerts users when prices genuinely drop  

### How It Works
- Track **10–15 popular products** (laptops, phones)
- Daily scraping via **Scrapy**
- Store full price history in **PostgreSQL**
- Analyze discount authenticity & buying patterns
- Notify users via **Telegram / Email**

### Technical Implementation

**Week 2–4: Data Pipeline (Holiday Sprint)**
- Scrapy spiders (Shopee + Tiki)
- PostgreSQL schema (`products`, `price_history`, `alerts`)
- Automated daily scraping (cron)
- Data validation & error handling

**Week 5–6: Analysis & Insights**
- Price trend analysis
- Fake vs real discount detection
- Statistical tests
- Jupyter notebooks with insights

**Week 7–8: User Application**

- Telegram bot integration
- Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
- Onboard **5–10 real users**

### Expected Impact
- **Users:** 5–10 active users
- **Savings:** ~1–2M VND per user
