📦 PROJECT 1: E-Commerce Sales Analysis
Timeline: Week 1-2 (Current)
Status: 📋 Planning Phase
Skill Level: ⭐⭐ Beginner-friendly
Reality Check: ✅ Fully achievable!

Dataset:

Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset (Olist) - 100K real orders
Source: Kaggle
Tables: customers, orders, products, payments, reviews
Scope (Focused & Realistic):

5 Core Analyses:

Revenue Analysis - Monthly trends, top products, revenue by region
Customer Insights - New vs returning, geographic distribution, AOV
Product Performance - Best/worst categories, ratings, delivery impact
Payment Patterns - Payment methods, installment analysis
Operational Metrics - Delivery times, late deliveries, satisfaction
Tech Stack:

SQL (PostgreSQL)
Advanced Analytics (CTEs, Window Functions)
Deliverables:

✅ 5-8 well-documented SQL queries
✅ 1-page Executive Summary
✅ 3-5 Key Business Recommendations
✅ Professional GitHub README
Why This Works:

Real dataset → credible
Focused scope → completable in 2 weeks
Business insights → shows analytical thinking
Quality over quantity

🎯 PROJECT 2: Customer Behavior Analysis with Python
Timeline: Week 5-6
Status: 📅 Planned
Skill Level: ⭐⭐⭐ Intermediate
Reality Check: ✅ Achievable after 4 weeks Python

Dataset:

Online Retail Dataset (UCI) - 500K+ transactions
Source: Kaggle
Real UK retail data, perfect for segmentation
Scope (Realistic):

3 Main Analyses:

RFM Segmentation

Calculate Recency, Frequency, Monetary
Create 4-5 customer segments
Visualize with scatter plots
Basic CLV Estimation

Simple CLV formula (no complex ML)
Identify top 20% customers
Average customer value
Purchase Patterns

Cohort analysis (simple)
Product combinations
Seasonal trends
Tech Stack:

SQL for data extraction
Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn ONLY)
NO machine learning yet
Jupyter Notebook
Deliverables:

✅ Jupyter Notebook with clear sections
✅ 5-7 visualizations
✅ Customer segment profiles
✅ 1-page action plan per segment
Why This Works:

Reality Check: ✅ 1 week sufficient if focused

Dataset:

Reuse Project 1 data (Brazilian E-Commerce)
Saves time, shows ability to build on previous work
Scope (Focused Dashboard):

6 Key Metrics (not 15+):

Overview Tab:

Total Revenue (YoY/MoM %)
Total Orders
Average Order Value
Customer Count
Sales Performance Tab:

Revenue by Month (line chart)
Top 10 Products (bar chart)
Sales by State (map)
Filters:

Date range slider
Product category filter
State filter
NO FORECASTING (that's ML, not BI basics)

Scope (Simple ML Approach):

Exploratory Analysis

Sales trends visualization
Seasonality detection
Feature correlation
Feature Engineering (Basic)

Day of week, Month, Quarter
Holiday indicator
Rolling averages (7-day, 30-day)
Modeling (START SIMPLE)

Linear Regression first
Then Random Forest (not XGBoost yet)
Compare only 2 models
Evaluation

RMSE, MAE metrics
Visual: Actual vs Predicted
Error analysis
Tech Stack:

Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
Jupyter Notebook
(Optional) Streamlit for simple web app
Deliverables:
