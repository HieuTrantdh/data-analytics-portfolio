##  About Me

I am a second-year student at Vietnam National University, Hanoi, focused on building a strong **foundation in data analytics and data systems** by solving real-world problems.

This portfolio reflects an **end-to-end, system-oriented** approach to learning:

**Identify problems** → design solutions → build data pipelines → deploy applications → evaluate with real users

**Timeline**: January – July 2026 (24 weeks)
**Goal**: Secure a **Technical Data Analyst** Internship, while developing skills that bridge analytics and data engineering through hands-on, user-facing projects.

##  What Makes This Portfolio Different

###  Real Users, Real Impact
- Each project is designed for **real users**, typically ranging from tens to hundreds

- Focus on measurable outcomes such as cost savings, improved visibility, or better decision-making

- User feedback is used to validate assumptions and guide iteration

### 🇻🇳 Vietnam-Specific Problems
- E-commerce price tracking on Shopee and Tiki

- Hanoi air quality monitoring

- Tools to support VNU students in academic workflows

- These are problems grounded in local context, using real data sources rather than curated datasets.

###  End-to-End Ownership
- Not limited to isolated SQL queries or notebooks

- Projects cover the full lifecycle: **problem definition, data collection, storage, processing, deployment, and iteration
**
- Emphasis on clean structure, maintainability, and clarity of data flow

### Deployed, System-Backed Applications

- Interactive applications built with Streamlit and messaging bots

- Database-backed storage and structured data workflows

- Hands-on experience with deployment, monitoring, and ongoing improvement based on real usage

##  Project 1: Vietnam E-Commerce Price Intelligence  
**Week 2–8 | Web Scraping + SQL + Python + Deployment**  
 *In Progress*

### Real Problem  
Shopee & Tiki prices fluctuate constantly.  
Fake discounts mislead Vietnamese consumers, making it hard to know **when to buy**.

### My Solution  
An **automated price tracking system** that:
- Monitors prices daily  
- Detects **real vs fake discounts**  
- Alerts users when prices genuinely drop  

### How It Works
- Track **10–15 popular products** (laptops, phones)
- Daily scraping via **Scrapy**
- Store full price history in **PostgreSQL**
- Analyze discount authenticity & buying patterns
- Notify users via **Telegram / Email**

### Technical Implementation

**Week 2–4: Data Pipeline (Holiday Sprint)**
- Scrapy spiders (Shopee + Tiki)
- PostgreSQL schema (`products`, `price_history`, `alerts`)
- Automated daily scraping (cron)
- Data validation & error handling

**Week 5–6: Analysis & Insights**
- Price trend analysis
- Fake vs real discount detection
- Statistical tests
- Jupyter notebooks with insights

**Week 7–8: User Application**
- Streamlit app (search, charts, alerts)
- Telegram bot integration
- Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
- Onboard **5–10 real users**

### Expected Impact
- **Users:** 5–10 active users
- **Savings:** ~1–2M VND per user
- **Insights:** % of fake discounts uncovered
- **Validation:** User testimonials

 Dataset: Original data scraped from Shopee & Tiki
