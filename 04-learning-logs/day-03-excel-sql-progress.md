# Day 3: Excel Intermediate & SQL Window Functions
**Date:** January 23, 2026  
**Focus:** Excel mastery + Advanced SQL patterns  
**Time:** 4 hours

## 🎯 Goals Completed
- [x] Master Excel PivotTables
- [x] Learn VLOOKUP & Power Query
- [x] Solve 10 more SQL problems
- [x] Practice Window Functions

## 📚 What I Learned

### Excel Skills
1. **PivotTables:**
   - Created dynamic summaries from raw data
   - Used calculated fields
   - Applied filters and slicers
   
2. **VLOOKUP:**
   - Syntax: `=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index, [range_lookup])`
   - Use cases: Merging data from multiple tables
   - Learned when to use XLOOKUP instead

3. **Power Query:**
   - Imported data from multiple sources
   - Basic transformations (filter, remove duplicates)
   - Merge queries

### SQL - Window Functions
- `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assign unique numbers
- `RANK()`: Same rank for ties, gaps in sequence
- `DENSE_RANK()`: Same rank, no gaps
- `PARTITION BY`: Group calculations
